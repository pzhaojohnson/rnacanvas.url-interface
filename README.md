# Quickstart

## Drawing a structure

Utilize the `sequence` and `dot_bracket` URL parameters
to draw a structure specified in dot-bracket notation.

For example, a hairpin structure
with sequence `GGGGAAAACCCC` and secondary structure `((((....)))`
would be drawn by the following URL.

```
https://code.rnacanvas.app?sequence=GGGGAAAACCCC&dot_bracket=((((....)))
```
